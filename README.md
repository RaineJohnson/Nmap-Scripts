This repository contains a list of nmap scripts written in Lua that can be used through the nmap scripting engine to execute various scans. The finger-scan file uses the finger service to look for usernames on a linux machine. Note that the finger service isn't actually running through this script, and we're just assuming that in this scenario finger is running on port 79. The simple-http-scan file scans open HTTP ports on a simulated network and prints out specific information based on the scan.
